# ac-library-hs

Haskell port of [ac-library](https://github.com/atcoder/ac-library), a library for competitive programming on [AtCoder](https://atcoder.jp/).

The `main` branch is the version avaiable on AtCoder (+ documentation fixes). See `dev` branch for upcoming updates.

## Notes

- The library is mainly for AtCoder and only GHC 9.8.4 is guaranteed to be supported.
- Functions primarily use half-open interval `[l, r)`.
- The `Extra` module contains additional utilities beyond the original C++ library.

## Usage

See the [API documentation on Hackage](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/ac-library-hs) for more information.
