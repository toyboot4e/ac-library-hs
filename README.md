# ac-library-hs

Haskell port of [ac-library](https://github.com/atcoder/ac-library), a library for competitive programming on [AtCoder](https://atcoder.jp/).

## Notes

- The library is mainly for AtCoder and only GHC 9.8.4 is guaranteed to be supported.
- Unlike `Prelude`, it primarily uses the half-open interval `[l, r)`.
- The `Internal` module is unstable and does not follow PVP.
- The `Extra` module provides with extra contents not in the original `ac-library`. Note that they're less tested.

## Usage

See the API documentation for more information.
