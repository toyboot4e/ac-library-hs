# ac-library-hs

Haskell port of [ac-library](https://github.com/atcoder/ac-library), a library for competitive programming on [AtCoder](https://atcoder.jp/).

## Notes

- The library is mainly for AtCoder and only GHC 9.8.4 is guaranteed to be supported.
- It primarily uses half-open intervals `[l, r)`.
- The `Extra` module provides with extra contents not in the original `ac-library`. Note that they're less tested!

## Usage

See the API documentation for more information.
