Feel free to create any issues, but consider the target branch.

- `main` branch is the version available on AtCoder. Source change that doesn't change the compiled code should come to this branch.
  - Documentation fixes
  - Test fixes
  - CI fixes
  - etc.
- `dev` branch is the version for the next AtCoder language update after 2025. Source change should come to this branch.
